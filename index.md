# About Me
I am now a postgraduate student at the Institue of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, and I will graduate in June 2023.  My research interests mainly focus on the Machine Learning and Graph Representation  Learning, especially the application of Graph Neural Network (GNN).

Prior to joining ICT, I got my bachelor degree from ShangHaiJiaoTong University (SJTU) in 2020.
