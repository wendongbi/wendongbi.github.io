# About Me
I am now a postgraduate student in Prof. [Huawei Shen](http://www.ict.cas.cn/sourcedb_2018_ict_cas/cn/jssrck/201402/t20140221_4037648.html)'s Group at the Institue of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, and I will graduate in June 2023.  My research interests mainly focus on the Machine Learning and Graph Representation  Learning, especially the application of Graph Neural Network (GNN).

Prior to joining ICT, I recieved my bachelor degree in computer science (machine learning) and technology from ShangHaiJiaoTong University (SJTU) in 2020. And I used to do research work in ThinkLab (Prof. Junchi Yan's Group) from 2019 to 2020.
