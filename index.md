# About Me
Wendong is a master student at Prof. [Huawei Shen](http://www.ict.cas.cn/sourcedb_2018_ict_cas/cn/jssrck/201402/t20140221_4037648.html)'s Group at the Institue of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, and he will graduate in June 2023.  Wendong's research interests mainly focus on the Machine Learning and Graph Representation  Learning, especially the applied research of Graph Representation Learning, Graph Neural Networks.

Prior to joining ICT, he recieved the bachelor degree in computer science and technology (machine learning) from ShangHaiJiaoTong University (SJTU) in 2020. And he used to do research in [ThinkLab](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn) (Prof. Junchi Yan's Group) at [MoE-AI-Lab@SJTU](https://ailab-moe.sjtu.edu.cn) from 2019 to 2020.
